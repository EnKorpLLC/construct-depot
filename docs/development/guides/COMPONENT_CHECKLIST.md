## Overview

This document provides information about COMPONENT_CHECKLIST.


## Pre-Development Checklist

- [ ] Verify CI pipeline status

## Development Checklist

### File Structure and Naming
- [ ] Use PascalCase for component file names
- [ ] Place in appropriate directory structure
- [ ] Create test file in __tests__ directory
- [ ] Add component story if applicable
✅ Automated: Verified by component structure checker

### Component Setup
- [ ] Add 'use client' directive if needed
- [ ] Import dependencies with correct casing
- [ ] Define proper prop types/interfaces
- [ ] Export component with PascalCase name
✅ Automated: Verified by ESLint and component checker

### Imports and Exports
- [ ] Use correct import paths
- [ ] Maintain proper casing in imports
- [ ] Use named exports appropriately
- [ ] Import only necessary dependencies
✅ Automated: Verified by import path checker

### Type Safety
- [ ] Define prop types/interfaces
- [ ] Use proper type annotations
- [ ] Avoid any type
- [ ] Handle nullable values
✅ Automated: Verified by TypeScript checker

### Testing
- [ ] Create test file with proper naming
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Add integration tests if needed
✅ Automated: Test file naming verified

## Pre-Commit Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] Run ESLint and fix issues
- [ ] Run type checker
- [ ] Verify component structure
- [ ] Check import paths
✅ Automated: Verified by pre-commit hooks

### Testing
- [ ] Run unit tests
- [ ] Run integration tests
- [ ] Verify test coverage
- [ ] Update snapshots if needed
✅ Automated: Runs in CI pipeline

## Deployment Checklist

### Build Verification
- [ ] Verify component builds successfully
- [ ] Check for console warnings/errors
- [ ] Verify import resolution
- [ ] Test in production mode
✅ Automated: Verified by CI pipeline

### Documentation
- [ ] Update component documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples
- [ ] Document props and types
- [ ] Update changelog if needed

## CI Integration

### Automated Checks
The following checks run automatically in CI:
1. Component Structure Verification
   - File naming conventions
   - Export naming
   - Directory structure
   
2. Import Path Validation
   - Correct casing
   - Valid paths
   - Proper module resolution
   
3. Test File Verification
   - Naming conventions
   - Location in __tests__ directory
   
4. ESLint Validation
   - Component rules
   - Import/export rules
   - React hooks rules
   
5. TypeScript Checks
   - Type safety
   - Prop types
   - Return types

### CI Workflow
- Runs on every push to main
- Runs on pull requests
- Blocks merging if checks fail
- Provides detailed error reporting

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Component Structure
- Issue: Wrong file naming
  Solution: Use PascalCase and run verify-component-names.ts

### Import Paths
- Issue: Incorrect casing
  Solution: Run fix-imports.ts

### Test Files
- Issue: Incorrect naming
  Solution: Run fix-test-names.ts

### Build Issues
- Issue: Module resolution
  Solution: Check import paths and webpack config

## Component Creation Guidelines

### Client vs Server Components
- [ ] Determine if the component needs client-side interactivity
- [ ] Add `'use client'` directive if using:
  - React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
  - Browser APIs
  - Event handlers
  - Client-side routing
- [ ] Place directive at the very top of the file
- [ ] Consider splitting into client/server components for better performance

### File Structure and Naming
- [ ] Use PascalCase for component files (e.g., `Button.tsx`, `UserProfile.tsx`)
- [ ] Use kebab-case for non-component files (e.g., `api-utils.ts`)
- [ ] Place components in appropriate directory structure
- [ ] Ensure file name matches component name

### Imports and Exports
- [ ] Use consistent import paths with `@/` prefix
- [ ] Match import path casing exactly with file system
- [ ] Use named exports for utility functions
- [ ] Use default exports for main components

### Type Safety
- [ ] Define proper TypeScript interfaces for props
- [ ] Use proper type imports
- [ ] Avoid using `any` type
- [ ] Document complex prop types

### Performance Considerations
- [ ] Implement proper error boundaries
- [ ] Use appropriate loading states
- [ ] Consider implementing Suspense boundaries
- [ ] Optimize re-renders with useMemo/useCallback where needed

### Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for component logic
- [ ] Include integration tests for complex interactions
- [ ] Test error states and loading states
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior

## Common Issues Prevention

### Server Component Issues
```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - Using hooks without 'use client'
import { useState } from 'react';
export default function Component() {
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  // ...
}

// ✅ Correct - Adding 'use client' directive
'use client';
import { useState } from 'react';
export default function Component() {
  const [state, setState] = useState();
  // ...
}
```typescript

### Import Path Issues
```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - Incorrect casing
import { button } from '@/components/ui/button';

// ✅ Correct - Matching file system casing
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/Button';
```typescript

### Type Safety Issues
```typescript
// ❌ Wrong - Using any
interface Props {
  data: any;
}

// ✅ Correct - Proper typing
interface Props {
  data: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    value: number;
  };
}
```typescript

## Deployment Considerations
- [ ] Verify component works in production build
- [ ] Check for any environment-specific code
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies are properly listed
- [ ] Test component in deployment environment

## Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Follow component naming conventions
- [ ] Verify proper use of 'use client' directive
- [ ] Check import path casing
- [ ] Review type safety
- [ ] Verify error handling
- [ ] Check for performance optimizations
- [ ] Ensure proper testing coverage

## Notes
- Keep components focused and single-responsibility
- Consider extracting complex logic into custom hooks
- Document any non-obvious implementation details
- Follow the established project patterns
